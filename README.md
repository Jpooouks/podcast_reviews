# Podcast Reviews Project
## The Dashboard
A Looker dashboard had to be created as a part of this project. It can be found [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/9434ef96-ac9d-4dfa-9388-c237a316e2cd).
## The Dataset
2 million podcast reviews for 100k podcasts, updated monthly. This dataset is intended to aid in analysis of text feedback and review data. The manner in which the sample was aquired is unclear.
## Objective 
The objective for this project is two-fold:

-   Explore sample and its features utilising typical EDA methods.
-   Raise hypotheses about the broader population, which the sample represents, and establish possibly significant results.
