# Podcast Reviews Project
Project for the TC DS Inferential Statistics sprint.
## The Dataset
2 million podcast reviews for 100k podcasts, updated monthly. This dataset is intended to aid in analysis of text feedback and review data. The manner in which the sample was aquired is unclear.
## Objective 
The objective for this project is two-fold:

-   Explore sample and its features utilising typical EDA methods.
-   Raise hypotheses about the broader population, which the sample represents, and establish possibly significant results.
